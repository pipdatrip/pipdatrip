      <h2>Hello. <br />ðŸ‘‹</h2>
      <p>As you might have guessed my name is Pip, I'm from Manchester (UK), my career has been largely in finance and the craft beer scene
        however I have always been hugely enthusiastic about music, reading, writing, gaming, art and design. This has lead me to start creating
        my own websites and learning how to code.

      <h2>My Skills.</h2>

        <img class="lightbulb" src="images/lightbulb.png" alt="Lightbulb">
        <h3>Creativity</h3>
        <p class"creativity-desc">From an early age I have always been creative, from music, to writing, painting and cooking, whichever form it takes. Nothing quite beats getting lost in an idea for hours on end, that and watching an it grow from next to nothing, to a tangible conclusion.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="gaming" src="images/gamepad.png" alt="Gaming">
        <h3>Gaming</h3>
        <p class"gaming-skill-description">From a very early age I used to play around on my Grandads Comadore and Gameboy, I remember getting a SNES for my birthday along with The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past and that was me sold ever since. I've always loved the escapism of games and the worlds the developers build, they're almost like interactive films sometimes.</p>

      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="logic" src="images/logic.png" alt="Logic">
        <h3>Logical thinking</h3>
        <p class"logic-skill-description">As Vulcans would probably say, problems can always be solved with Logic. I like how even an insurmountable problem can be achieved after breaking it down into simpler chunks and tackling one thing at a time. Growing up on Zelda probably put me in good stead with this!</p>
      </div>
      <div class="skill-row">
        <img class="communication" src="images/chat.png" alt="Communication">
        <h3>Communication</h3>
        <p class"communication-skill-description">Communication is so important in the modern age. Understanding what people are saying and knowing how to use that information is key in most jobs I've found. Luckily for me not only have I always been a bit of a chatterbox, I'm also a good listener.</p>
